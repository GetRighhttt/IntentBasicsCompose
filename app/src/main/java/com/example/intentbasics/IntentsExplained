According to Google Developers:
"An intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component."

There are 3 fundamentals ways in android in which you will most often see intents used with Android
components:
1. Starting an activity
2. Starting a service
3. Delivering a broadcast

Intent Types:
1. Explicit Intents: used to specify which application will satisfy the intent by supplying the
app's package name or a fully-qualified component class. These intents are typically used when we
specifically know exactly which component in our application or what we "intend" to do in our app.

2. Implicit Intents: used when we do not name a specific component in our application, but instead
declare a general action to perform, which allows a component from another app to handle it. If you
for example need to show a user's location on a map, or something along those lines,
you should use an implicit intent to do so.

Intent Filter
An intent filter allow us to register our application or to specify that our application can receive
certain types of intents.
