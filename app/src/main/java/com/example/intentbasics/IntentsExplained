According to Google Developers:
"An intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component."

There are 3 fundamentals ways in android in which you will most often see intents used with Android
components:
1. Starting an activity
2. Starting a service
3. Delivering a broadcast

Intent Types:
1. Explicit Intents: used to specify which application will satisfy the intent by supplying the
app's package name or a fully-qualified component class. These intents are typically used when we
specifically know exactly which component in our application or what we "intend" to do in our app.

2. Implicit Intents: used when we do not name a specific component in our application, but instead
declare a general action to perform, which allows a component from another app to handle it. If you
for example need to show a user's location on a map, or something along those lines,
you should use an implicit intent to do so.

Intent Filter
An intent filter declares the capabilities of its parent component: what an activity or service
can do and what types of broadcast a receiver can handle. It opens the component to receiving
intents of the advertised type while filtering out those that aren't meaningful for the component.
It also allows us to specify what types of intents are application can receive and handle.
So when we want to share a picture, some text, an email, etc. we can specify this in our Manifest
file using our intent filters.
